📊 **Visualising Netflix's Catalogue Trends with Amazon QuickSight**

**Project Overview**  
Using Amazon QuickSight, I dove deep into Netflix’s content data to uncover and display catalogue trends in visually compelling ways.

### Project Highlights
🔍 Throughout this AWS project, I learned how to:
✅ Upload and securely store datasets in **Amazon S3**.  
✅ Connect these datasets seamlessly to **Amazon QuickSight** for interactive analysis.  
✅ Design and build visualisations, including **donut charts, bar graphs, and tables**.  
✅ Address complex data questions with QuickSight’s tools, creating insights from raw data.

🌟 **Project Highlight:**  
The grand finale was building a cohesive dashboard to unite all visualisations—a rewarding process that brought every element together!
